## dumpstr mapping illegal dumping

## Getting the code running

frontend is in the client folder. 

The backend is run though 'nodemon server.js' (in the dumpstr main directory)

The Frontend is run from 'npm start' (while in the client folder)

At the start, ask questions, change anything in your own branch and make a request if you have a good idea. Auth is currently using OAuth from google and the server is graphql. Would love to know your thoughts. I'll update this with more comments since this was just hashed together fast. Happy coding!
